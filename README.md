**Mandelbrot Set Visualization**

This program can be configured in 2 ways.

1.) It can run interactively. The user can drag rectangles over areas of the visualization and the program will zoom into those areas. Press 'a' to go back a level.

2.) It can be run to dump images for a zoom. You can give it a point to zoom in on, and it will dump high quality images that can then be compiled into a video via the makeVideo.sh script.
